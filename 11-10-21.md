### Copying a repository (repo) from GitHub

1. In iTerm, make sure you are the in the directory where you want to keep classwork.
2. Visit the url for the repository https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/in-class-exercises-and-examples and copy the link.
3. In iTerm, run `git clone <url> .` The `.` is important, it means "in this folder, don't make a new folder." When you see `<>`, that is a placeholder and everything inside it as well as the `<>` will be replaced.
